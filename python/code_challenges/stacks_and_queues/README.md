# Stacks and Queues

Using a Linked List as the underlying data storage mechanism, implement both a Stack and a Queue.

## Challenge

create a stack, queue and implement all the necessary functions to handle the classes.

## Approach and Efficiency

Worked with JJ.

## stack queue pseudo

Create a new class called pseudo queue.
Do not use an existing Queue.
Instead, this PseudoQueue class will implement our standard queue interface (the two methods listed below),
Internally, utilize 2 Stack instances to create and manage the queue

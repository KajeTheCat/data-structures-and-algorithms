# Array Binary Search
The problem domain was to write a function called BinarySearch which takes in 2 parameters: a sorted array and the search key. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return the index of the arrayâ€™s element that is equal to the value of the search key, or -1 if the element is not in the array.

## Approach & Efficiency
The goal of the project was to essentiall search sorted arrays using binary search until you found a target number. Our approach was to find the length of the array, cut it in half and check the index if it was greater, equal or less than the target.

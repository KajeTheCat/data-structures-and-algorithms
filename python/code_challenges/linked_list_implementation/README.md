# Singly Linked List:
A singly linked list is a kind of list that is one essentially a one way street down to the last node or tail.
## Challenge
Create a linked list class. When instantiated make an empty list. Include a way to insert values, a way to stringify, and a way to check if something is in the list.
## Approach & efficiency
O(n)for the string and includes method due to the list having potential of the item being the last.
O(1)for the insert method due to it being added and changed to be the new head.
## API
1. to_string
2. insert
3. includes
